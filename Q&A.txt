API Gateway

How many ways to make an API can authorizer: 
1.API Gateway supports three types of authorizers:

	1.Cognito User Pools Authorizer: Uses Amazon Cognito user pools to manage authentication and authorization.
	2.Lambda Authorizer: A Lambda function is used to control access by validating tokens or request parameters.
	3.IAM Roles and Policies: You can apply AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies to control access using the caller's AWS credentials.

2.API Gateway timeout limit: The maximum timeout limit for an API Gateway is 29 seconds. After this time, if no response is received, API Gateway will return a 504 error to the client.

3.Why use proxy integration in API Gateway: Proxy integration allows API Gateway to pass the entire request payload directly to a backend and then send the response back to the client without modifications. Reasons to use proxy integration:

	1.Simplicity: Allows API Gateway to act as a simple pass-through mechanism, so developers can manage the request/response logic in the backend itself.
	2.Flexibility: You can handle complex routing, custom logic, and transformations directly in your backend services.
	3.Single endpoint: Instead of managing multiple individual routes in API Gateway, proxy integration allows a single endpoint to handle all requests.


Lambda
1.What is cost efficiency in Lambda: Lambda is cost-efficient because it uses a pay-per-use model:

	1.No idle costs: You are charged only for the actual compute time your code consumes, measured in milliseconds, and not for idle server time.
	2.Automatic scaling: Lambda automatically scales up based on the number of incoming events, so you don't have to pay for pre-provisioned resources.
	3.Free tier: AWS Lambda offers a free tier of 1 million requests and 400,000 GB-seconds of compute time per month.

2.What is event-driven processing in Lambda: Event-driven processing means Lambda functions are triggered by events from other AWS services or external sources. Examples include:

	1.S3 event: When an object is uploaded to an S3 bucket, a Lambda function can be triggered to process the object.
	2.DynamoDB stream: Lambda can process changes in a DynamoDB table (insert, modify, delete events).
	3.API Gateway trigger: Lambda can be triggered to handle HTTP requests from an API Gateway.

3.Lambda runtime: Lambda supports multiple runtimes that enable developers to run code in various programming languages. The supported runtimes include:

Node.js
Python
Ruby
Java
Go
.NET Core
